## Setup

Install dependencies and build. See `package.json` scripts.

### `build`

Build the library. The output code will appear in the `dist` folder. It should work on the web in browsers, and on Node without changes or further configuration.

### `test`

Test the code. Run this if you make any changes to ensure your changes will respect the existing functionality. These tests will need updated if you want to keep your work consistent if you happen to change the return types or parameter shapes.
